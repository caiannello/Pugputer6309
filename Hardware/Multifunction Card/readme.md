Note, the Atmega based schematic and layout provided here has not yet 
left the breadboard stage, and I'm considering instead making one
based on a hugely more powerful Teensy 4.1 or Raspberry Pi Pico 
instead.

Currently, these alternatives are also in the breadboard stage.

**RASPBERRY PI PICO VERSION

```
TEENSY VERSION

Consists of the LV parallel interface card, available in the repo, 
connected to a Teensy 4.1 + sound board.

The Teensy 4.1 is connected to a parallel interface card with the 
following connections:

Parallel Card       Teensy Pin
-------------       ----------
VCC                 None
GND                 GND
+3V3                3v

CWR                 2
CRD                 3
UWR                 4
URD                 5

DB0                 28
DB1                 29
DB2                 30
DB3                 31
DB4                 32
DB5                 33
DB6                 34
DB7                 35

The firmware for the Teensy is an Arduino sketch provided
in /Software/Teensy 4.1/multipass

For information about the parallel interface signals and protocol,
see the README in the LV Parallel IO Card's directory.
