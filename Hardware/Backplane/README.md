## Backplane v2

This is a backplane based on 60-pin, 2.57mm pich, card-edge connectors,
compatible with CPU Card v2 and the other v2 cards.

I think these are the same dimensions as the cartridge
connector on the original Nintendo Famicom.

This time, the form factor is a box shape instead of the flattened all-in-one-keyboard design used in v0.
For something more compact, but much more expensive to fabricate, see v0/ .
