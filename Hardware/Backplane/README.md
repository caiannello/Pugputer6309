## Backplane v2
```
This is a backplane for use with Pugputer v2, based on card edge-connectors
instead of pin headers. 

The connectors are 0.1" pitch, 60-pins, which I think is the same as the
cartridge slot on the original Nintendo Famicom.

This backplane will make the system have a brick form factor ather than the
flattened all-in-one-keyboard design of v0, but the PCB fabrication cost will
be much lower since it is a 2-layer rather than a 4-layer board.
