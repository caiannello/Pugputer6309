PUGPUTER 6309 - Hardware
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The schematics and board artwork for this project were created using
Cadsoft EAGLE v4.16r2 Professional, which is an older CAD tool available as
freeware (crippleware) for Linux, Windows, and OSX.

I would steer clear of newer versions of EAGLE. (Cadsoft was eventually 
bought-out by Autodesk, and they moved EAGLE to a money-grubbing, 
subscription-based business model. 

4.16r2 is old, but pretty nice, and it seems to still work well in Windows 10.

The freeware version of Eagle has limited board size and layercount, but all
boards are viewable. Editing may be another story. TODO: Learn Kicad?
