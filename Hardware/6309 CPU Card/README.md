## 6309 CPU Card v2
```
3/1/2024 UPDATE:

Added a new v2 CPU card. It has the same HD63C09 clocked at 3.57 MHz,
32K Flash ROM, and serial UART, but it adds 1 MB SRAM, expandable to
4 MB, and a real-time clock interrupt.

Also, rather than a pin header connection to the backplane, this one
uses a classic 60-pin card-edge connector similar to a Nintendo Famicom
cartridge.

Moved previous version to past_revs/ subfolder.

## Memory Paging Scheme
```
Two 74LS670 chips are added to the design which provide four
writable bytes at CPU addresses $ffec - $ffef. These act like dual-
ported RAMs and enable each of the four 16KB sections of the CPU
address space to be independently mapped a different 16KB page of
physical memory (up to 4MB.)

CPU Address lines A14 and A15 select which register is active, which
then provides extended address bits E14...E21 to the system. These are
combined with CPU address bits A0...A13 to form the final 22-bit
physical address.

The initial state of the registers is unknown on startup and must be
initialized before any RAM access should occur. Initially, these are
mapped to the first four pages of physical memory by setting the bank
registers as follows:

Sect   CPU Adrs    22-bit physical Adrs     Bank Reg (E21...E14)
0      $0000       %0000000000000000000000  $00
1      $4000       %0000000100000000000000  $01
2      $8000       %0000001000000000000000  $02
3      $c000       %0000001100000000000000  $03

```
## Expanded Memory
```
For memory addresses beyond the onboard 1 MB, one or more bits
E20...E21 will be set in the bank register. The address decoder
in the PAL will not select the onboard RAM in this case and will
instead set bus signal XMEM to high. This can be used to 
implement expanded memory.
```
## Real-Time Interrupt
```
The real-time interupt causes an /IRQ to happen at a rate of 16 Hz.

This IRQ is shared with the UART, so the UART ISR will be called
first, see that nothing serial happened to cause the interrupt,
and fall-through to a timer ISR which simply counts ticks. This
enables date and time to be tracked. There's no battery backup,
so current date and time must be provided on each powerup, either
manually or via network.

Date and time aren't the main reason the timer was added, though.

In the use case where there is just a CPU card being used with a
serial terminal, a timer is needed to properly differentiate between
certain key presses. For example, when escape is pressed, a single
0x1b character is sent to the UART, but pressing cursor-up sends a
sequence of three characters, starting with that same escape code:
0x1b, '[', 'A'.
Most terminal emulators, even BASH, use a timer to distinguish between
single escape characters and ANSI escape sequences. I hated the idea
of implementing this timer with a software busy loop, but there's not
enough room on the CPU card for dedicated clock/timer chips such as
the DS1287 or W65C22 VIA, so I went with something simpler.
```
## Address Decoding Notes
```
This is mostly just work-in-progress thoughts about how to go about
implementing the memoty map on the system and programming the PAL.
Some of this is implemented with discrete logic on the card because
the PAL doesnt have enough inputs to handle everything alone.

# Discrete combinatorial logic to help onboard PAL

hn3    = a15 & a14 & a13 & a12         # high adrs nybble == $f
hn2    = a11 & a10 & a9 & a8           # next adrs nybble == $f
hiadr  = a19 | a20 | a21               # adrs > 512KB (extended memory)

# Inputs to onboard PAL

hn3, hn2, hiadr, a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2

# Outputs from onboard PAL

extram  = !hn3 & hiadr                                # bus: select RAM expansion
io      = hn3 & hn2 & !hn1                            # bus: select misc IO
/ram    = ! ( !hn3 & !hiadr )                         # onboard: 0000 - efff  : select RAM
/rom    = ! (  hn3 & ( !hn2 | ( hn2 & hn1 ) ))        # onboard: f000 - feff, fff0 - ffff : select ROM
/mapper = ! (  io & sioh & a3 &  a2 )                 # onboard: ffec - ffef select banking registers
/uart   = ! (  io & sioh & a3 & !a2 )                 # onboard: ffe8 - ffeb select serial UART

// outputs from pals on other cards:

/v9958  = ! (  io & sioh  & !a3 & a2 )              # ffe4 - ffe7  Video Card video chip
/opl3   = ! (  io & sioh  & !a3 & !a2 )             # ffe0 - ffe3  Video Card music chip

/via    = ! (  io & a7 & !a6 & a5 & a4 )            # ffb0 - ffbf  W65C22 Versatile Interface Adaptor
                                                    # (Used for SD card, keyboard, game controllers, etc.)
