## 6309 CPU Card v2
```
3/1/2024 UPDATE:

Added a new v2 CPU card. It has the same HD63C09 clocked at 3.57 MHz,
32K Flash ROM, and serial UART, but it adds 512k SRAM, expandable to
4 MB, and a real-time clock interrupt.

Also, rather than a pin header connection to the backplane, this one
uses a classic 60-pin card-edge connector similar to a Nintendo Famicom
cartridge.

Moved previous version to past_revs/ subfolder.

## Real-Time Interrupt
```
The real-time interupt causes an /IRQ to happen at a rate of 16 Hz.

This IRQ is shared with the UART, so the UART interrupt will happen
first and see that nothing serial happened to cause the interrupt,
so the the ISR will fall-through to a timer ISR which simply counts
ticks. This enables date and time to be tracked. There's no battery
backup, so current date and time must be provided on each powerup,
either manually or via the network.

Date and time aren't the main reason the timer was added, though.

In the use case where there is just a CPU card being used with a
serial terminal, a timer is needed to properly differentiate between
certain key presses. For example, when escape is pressed, a single
0x1b character is sent to the UART, but pressing cursor-up sends a
sequence of three characters, starting with that same escape code:
0x1b, '[', 'A'.
Most terminal emulators, even BASH, use a timer to distinguish between
single escape characters and ANSI escape sequences. I hated the idea
of implementing this timer with a software busy loop, but there's not
enough room on the CPU card for dedicated clock/timer chips such as
the DS1287 or W65C22 VIA, so I went with something simpler.
```
## Memory Paging Scheme
```
Two SN74LS670D chips were added to the design. These provide a total
of four bytes registers (which act like dual-ported RAM) mapped to
CPU addresses $ffec - $ffef. These allow CPU address space to be
subdivided into four pages, each expanded with six additional
address bits, allowing a total of 4 megabytes of physical address
space.

When RAM is accessed, CPU address lines A14 and A15 are used to select
which bank register to use, causing that register to be the source of
the eight extended address bits, E14...E21. These are combined with
CPU address bits A0...A13 to make the final physical address. The
initial state of these registers on powerup is unknown, so one of the
first things the system must do after powerup (and before trying to
access any RAM) is to set default values. The banked memory pages are
 at CPU addresses $0000, $4000, $8000, and $c000, so if we want those
to correspond to the same physical addresses in RAM, the default
values can be determined as follows.

Page#  CPU Adrs    Physical Adrs            Bank Reg (E21...E14)
0      $0000       %0000000000000000000000  $00
1      $4000       %0000000100000000000000  $01
2      $8000       %0000001000000000000000  %02
3      $c000       %0000001100000000000000  %03

If instead the user wants access the second 64K of RAM in page 1
(CPU adrs $4000) ...

CPU Adrs    Physical Address         Bank Reg 1
$4000       %0000010000000000000000  $04

So in short, the bank register select which 16KB page will be
mapped to the specified bank.
```
## Expanded Memory
```
For memory addresses beyond the onboard 512KB, one or more bits
E19...E21 must be set in the bank register. The address decoder
in the PAL will not select the onboard RAM in this case, and instead
it will set bus signal XMEM to high. This signal can be used to
implement memory expansion up to 4 MB total.
```
## Address Decoding Notes
```
This is mostly just work-in-progress thoughts about how to go about
implementing the memoty map on the system and programming the PAL.
Some of this is implemented with discrete logic on the card because
the PAL doesnt have enough inputs to handle everything alone.

// combinatorial logic

hn3    = a15 & a14 & a13 & a12         # f...  implemented with discrete logic
hn2    = a11 & a10 & a9 & a8           # .f..  .||.
hn1    = a7 & a6 & a5 & a4             # ..f.  .||.
siol = a7 & a6 & !a5 & !a4             # ffc0 - ffcf implemented in PAL
siom = a7 & a6 & !a5 &  a4             # ffd0 - ffdf .||.
sioh = a7 & a6 &  a5 & !a4             # ffe0 - ffef .||.
hiadr  = a19 | a20 | a21               # true if address > onboard 512KB (discrete logic)

// Inputs to PAL:

hn3, hn2, hn1, hiadr, a7, a6, a5, a4, a3, a2

// Outputs from the PAL:

extram  = !hn3 & hiadr                                # for ram expansion card, connected to bus
io      = hn3 & hn2 & !hn1                            # for misc cards, connected to bus
/ram    = ! ( !hn3 & !hiadr )                         # 0000 - efff  (onboard chip select)
/rom    = ! (  hn3 & ( !hn2 | ( hn2 & hn1 ) ))        # f000 - feff, fff0 - ffff (onboard chip select)
/mapper = ! (  io & sioh & a3 &  a2 )                 # ffec - ffef (onboard chip select)
/uart   = ! (  io & sioh & a3 & !a2 )                 # ffe8 - ffeb (onboard chip select)

// outputs from pals on other cards:

/v9958  = ! (  io & sioh  & !a3 & a2 )              # ffe4 - ffe7  Video Card video chip
/opl3   = ! (  io & sioh  & !a3 & !a2 )             # ffe0 - ffe3  Video Card music chip

/via    = ! (  io & a7 & !a6 & a5 & a4 )            # ffb0 - ffbf  W65C22 Versatile Interface Adaptor
                                                    # (Used for SD card, keyboard, game controllers, etc.)
