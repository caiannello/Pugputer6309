3/1/2024 UPDATE:

Added a new v2 CPU card. It has the same HD63C09 clocked at 3.57 MHz,
32K Flash ROM, and serial UART, but it adds 512k SRAM, expandable to
4 MB, and a real-time clock interrupt.

Also, rather than a pin header connection to the backplane, this one
uses a classic 60-pin card-edge connector similar to a Nintendo Famicom
cartridge.

Moved previous version to past_revs/ subfolder.

## About the Timer Feature
```
The real-time interupt causes an /IRQ to happen at a rate of 16 Hz.

This IRQ is shared with the UART, so the UART interrupt will happen
first and see that nothing serial happened to cause the interrupt,
so the the ISR will fall-through to a timer ISR. The timer ISR simply
counts ticks, which enables date and time to be tracked. There's no
battery backup though, so current data and time must be provided on
each powerup, either manually or via the network.

Date and time aren't the main reason the timer was added, though.

In the use case where there is just a CPU card being used with a
serial terminal, a timer is needed to properly differentiate between
certain key presses. For example, when escape is pressed, a single
0x1b character is sent to the UART. Pressing cursor-up sends a
sequence of three characters, starting with the code for escape:
[0x1b, '[', 'A']   Most terminal emulators, even BASH, start a timer
when an escape code is received. If no other codes come in before the
timeout, the system assumes that escape was pressed. If instead, more
codes arrive, the system assumes an ANSI escape sequence is being
sent. I hated the idea of implementing this timer with a software
busy loop, and there's not enough room on the CPU card for dedicated
clock or timer chips such as the DS1287 or W65C22 VIA, so I went with
something much more basic.
