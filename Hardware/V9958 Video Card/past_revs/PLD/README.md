V9958 Video Card - PLD code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This directory contains the code for the PLD chip, the ATF16V8B.

The files are for WinCupl v5.30.4 by Atmel Corporation, which is a horribly
buggy application that crashes constantly, but I have found no alternative.

The .PLD file is the "source code" for the project, and the .JED file is the 
the resulting bitstream that gets programmed on the part.

The eeprom programmer I use is called TL866II-Plus, and the included sofware 
is Xgpro v10.80.  I can highly recommend the programmer and Xgpro.
