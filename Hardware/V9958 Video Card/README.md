## V9958 Video Card

This is the same Yamaha graphics processor that is used in the MSX 2+ line of Japanese home computers. It is a descendant of the TI V9918 VDP which was used in the TI-99/4A home computer and the ColecoVision game consoles.

There's enough empty space on the video card to add this little music synthesizer module, but that is still in the breadboard stage. The chip is a [Yamaha YMF262](https://www.polynominal.com/yamaha-opl3/) FM synthesizer.
