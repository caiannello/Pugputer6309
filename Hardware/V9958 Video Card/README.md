## V9958 Video Card

This is the same Yamaha graphics processor that is used in the MSX 2+ line of Japanese home computers. It is a descendant of the TI V9918 VDP which was used in the TI-99/4A home computer and the ColecoVision game console from the early 1980's.

## OPL3 Audio Module

There's enough empty space on the video card to add this little music synthesizer module, but that is still in the breadboard stage. The chips are [Yamaha YMF262](https://www.polynominal.com/yamaha-opl3/) FM synthesizer with a YAC512 stereo DAC and an audio buffer amplifier.
