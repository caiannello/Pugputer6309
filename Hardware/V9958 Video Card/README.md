## V9958 Video Card

This is the same Yamaha graphics processor that is used in the MSX 2+ line of Japanese home computers. It is a descendant of the TI V9918 VDP which was used in the TI-99/4A home computer and the ColecoVision game console from the early 1980's. A CXA2075M composite encoder chip is used to provide S-video and composite outputs. The picture quality is decent, though there are some very faint 'jail bars' in composite mode.

## OPL3 Audio Module

There's enough empty space on the video card to add this little music synthesizer module, but that is still in the breadboard stage. The chips are one [Yamaha YMF262](https://www.polynominal.com/yamaha-opl3/) FM synthesizer, a YAC512 Stereo DAC, and an MC33074 buffer amplifier.
