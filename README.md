WELCOME TO THE PUGPUTER 6309 PROJECT !!!

The Pugputer is a little labor of love, made as a tribute to the early home computers of the 1980's.  

It is based on the wonderful Hitachi HD63C09 CPU- an upgraded licensed clone of the venerable Motorola 6809, and uses vintage parts where appropriate. (Except RAM chips, which are plentiful and affordable these days, and a modern microcontroller to handle SD card, audio, and GPIO.)
