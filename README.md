WELCOME TO THE PUGPUTER 6309 PROJECT !!!

The Pugputer is a little labor of love, made as a tribute to the 
early home computers of the 1980's.  

It is based on the wonderful Hitachi HD63C09 CPU- an upgraded licensed clone 
of the venerable Motorola 6809, and uses vintage parts where appropriate. 
(Except RAM chips, which are plentiful and affordable these days, and a modern 
microcontroller to handle SD card, audio, and GPIO.)

Projects in the Hardware directory: 
(Using CADSOFT EAGLE 4.16r2)

  6309 CPU Card V0 - HD63C09P CPU, R65C51P2 UART, 64K RAM, 32K ROM 
  Backplane - Five card slots end-to-end for flatness 
  V9958 Video Card - Same graphics chip as the MSX 2+ home computer 
  Parallel IO Card - 5 Volts (Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega, etc.) 
  LV Parallel IO Card - 3.3 Volts (Teensy 4.1, ESP32, Pi, etc.)
  Multifunction card - Combination parallel card and Atmegs2560 with SD card, Audio, and GPIO

Projects in the Software Directory:  (All are work-in-progress, stay tuned.) 
(Using LWTOOLS/LWASM 4.20 for the 6309 assembly stuff)

  6309 Extended Basic - Microsoft, Grant Searle, Tom Circuit, and me
  Pugmon - ML Monitor
  Pugboot - Minimal bootloader
  Demos - graphics and sound examples in Assembly and BASIC
  Arduino UNO - Allows an Uno to be connected to the Pugputer (via parallel 
      IO card) to provide SD Card, SPI, PS/2 keyboard, and minimal (PWM) audio
  Teensy - Same as above, but for Teensy 4.1 and LV parallel IO card

3D Models 
(Using Trimble SketchUp MAKE 17.2.2555 for Windows 64-bit )
(Nice renders using Indigo Renderer by Glare Technologies)
