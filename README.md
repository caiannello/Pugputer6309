## Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
WELCOME TO THE PUGPUTER 6309 PROJECT !!!

The Pugputer is a little labor of love, made as a tribute to the 
early home computers of the 1980's.  

It is based on the Hitachi HD63C09 CPU- an upgraded licensed clone of the
venerable Motorola 6809, and uses vintage parts where appropriate. 
(Except RAM chips, which are plentiful and affordable these days, and a modern 
microcontroller to handle SD card and GPIO.)

Projects in the Hardware directory: 
  (Using CADSOFT EAGLE 4.16r2)

  6309 CPU Card -       HD63C09P CPU, R65C51P2 UART, 1MB RAM, 32K ROM, RTC
                        (Mem expandable to 4MB) 
  Backplane -           Five card slots, tombstone style 
  V9958 Video -         Same graphics chip as the MSX 2+ home computer 
                        Optional OPL3 synthesizer module (YMF262)
  VIA_SD_PSUP -         SD Card, SPI, I2C, ADC, parallel port, and power supply.
  3 MB RAM Expans. -    Gives the Pugputer more memory than actual pugs. 
  all-in-one -          Combines all of the above on one 10.6" x 3.5" board

Projects in the Software Directory:  (All are work-in-progress, stay tuned.) 
  (Using LWTOOLS/LWASM 4.20 for the 6309 assembly stuff)

  6309 Extended Basic -   Microsoft, Walter K. Zydhek, Grant Searle,
                          Tom Circuit, and me
  boot -                  Minimal bootloader (Also unfinished, but coming soon!)
  Pugmon -                ML Monitor (Far from complete)
  Demos -                 graphics and sound examples in Assembly and BASIC

3D Models 
  (Using Trimble SketchUp MAKE 17.2.2555 for Windows 64-bit )
(Nice renders using Indigo Renderer by Glare Technologies)

Lily from a local pond, converted to the V9958's high-color YJK mode using a Python utility. Please ignore my dog's toothpaste and "toothbrush". Please also ignore the ugly DRAM sidecar on the video card, I think the SRAM problem has been found. (I used a CMOS instead of a CMOS TTL latch.)

### v0 System (All-in one keyboard design)

This system has smaller cards with pin headers and can lie flat inside a keyboard enclosure, but it only has 64K of RAM and no bank switching, and the backplane is expensive to fabricate because it is a 4-layer board.

The card in the middle in the below image is a prototype multifunction card. It comprises a Teensy 4.1 in a ZIF socket with a piggybacked audio card, connected to the backplane via the LV Parallel interface. The USB host connector of the Teensy is connected to the keyboard, but I hope to have some kind of USB hub, eventually. Also note, the backplane shown doesn't space the cards far enough to allow all five to be populated at once. This has since been corrected in the board design, and the total length is still shorter than the keyboard at 13.8 out of 14.125 inches.

## Contact

If you are interested in this project or MC6809 and HD6309 CPU's in general, I post sporadic updates about this project on [this facebook group.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/6809assembly), and can be reached there (Craig Iannello). It's really great as far as technical groups go in that people are respectful and friendly, unlike some forums where trolls circle new members like sharks. (I'm looking at you, AVR Freaks!) If you'd prefer email, the address is my github user name as shown above, at that giant search engine company with a name which starts with a G.

## Todo: Youtube Videos

Once this project is further along, I plan on making some demo videos and putting them on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/appliedcryogenics). In the meantime, there's some older projects on there, so it may still be worth a browse.
