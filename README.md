WELCOME TO THE PUGPUTER 6309 PROJECT !!!

The Pugputer is a little labor of love, made as a tribute to the early home computers of the 1980's.  

It is based on the wonderful Hitachi HD63C09 CPU- an upgraded licensed clone of the venerable Motorola 6809, and uses vintage parts where appropriate. (Except RAM chips, which are plentiful and affordable these days, and a modern microcontroller to handle SD card, audio, and GPIO.)

Projects in the Hardware directory:

  6309 CPU Card V0 HD63C09P CPU, R65C51P2 UART, 64K RAM, 32K ROM 
  Backplane: Five card slots end-to-end for flatness 
  V9958 Video Card Same graphics chip as the MSX 2+ home computer 
  Parallel IO Card IO at 5 Volts (Arduino Uno/Nano/Mega, etc.) 
  LV Parallel IO Card IO at 3.3 Volts (Teensy 4.1, ESP32, Pi, etc.)
  Multifunction card is a combination parallel card and Atmegs2560 with SD card, Audio, and GPIO

Projects in the Software Directory:  (All are work-in-progress, stay tuned.) 

  6309 Extended Basic (Microsoft, Grant Searle, Tom Circuit, Me)
  Pugmon - ML Monitor
  Pugboot
  demos of sound and graphics (Assembly and BASIC)
  Arduino UNO code - Allows an Uno to be connected to the Pugputer (via parallel IO card) to provide SD Card, SPI, PS/2 keyboard, and minimal (PWM) audio
  Teensy Code - Same as above but for Teensy 4.1 and LV parallel IO card
